  <p><strong>About us:</strong> 
    <br>
    We have created this website so that we can provide charities to people who would like to donate to people who are going through domestic abuse. You will be provided with the top 5 domestic abuse charities around the world, and you will be able to donate to them to stop domestic abuse that is happening daily. </p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>How we can go about this idea:</strong> 
    <br>
    We came about this idea because we all agreed that it would be extremely helpful for people to have insightful resources if they ever wanted to donate to charities that can potentially save lives around the world.
