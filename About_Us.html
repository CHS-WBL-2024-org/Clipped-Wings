	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<main>
		We are students from Cumberland High School doing a project with URI and made this site to raise awareness of
			certain types of abuse such as verbal, sexual, physical, domestic, and other forms of abuse. We provide insight to
			those who need guidance about their own personal situations. We steer them towards charities that can provide
			extra help if needed. Below are links to YouTube videos that will provide more information about the charities. Some are full on descriptions, others being victim's life experiences. We enourage you to watch them and learn more about the charities.
